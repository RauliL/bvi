How to compile
==============

    cd bvi
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install


MAC OS X
========
Looks like the curses implementation in Darwin is really limited.
You should install and use ncurses instead. You can download it from
ftp.gnu.org; install it and then use
	./configure --with-ncurses=/usr/local/ncurses-5.2
